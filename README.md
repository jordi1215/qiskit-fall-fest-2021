## Qiskit Implementation

We used the Qiskit package to implement the CHSH game protocol. The CHSH game is an well-known non-local game in quantum information. The Qiskit textbook has some information on it but we still had to implement the game using mainly our own code.

After carefully verifying the algorithm by hand, we decided to implement a function where apply apply a Hadamard gate and a CNOT gate to two qubits so that they are entangled, and we will perform a rotation gate on either of the two qubits based on the inputs.
